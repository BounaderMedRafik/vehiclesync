# Vehicle Maintenance Tracker

This is a web application designed to help users track maintenance records for their vehicles.

## University Capstone Project

This project was developed as the capstone requirement for my Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering degree at Western Governors University (WGU). It represents the culmination of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program, applying concepts learned in software design, development, testing, and deployment. This project was also recognized with a Capstone Excellence Award from WGU for its quality and execution.

The application allows users to:

- Register and log in.
- Add vehicles to their virtual garage.
- Record maintenance activities for each vehicle, including date, mileage, type of maintenance, and cost.
- View reports summarizing maintenance expenses, such as annual totals and costs per vehicle or category.
